    # First build a hash mapping each value in the array to its frequencyâ€¦
    # arr = [1, 1, 1, 2, 3]
    # freq = arr.inject(Hash.new(0)) { |h,v| h[v] += 1; h }
    # #=> {1=>3, 2=>1, 3=>1}
    # then use the frequency table to find the element with the highest frequency:
    # arr.max_by { |v| freq[v] }
    # #=> 1
